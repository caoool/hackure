## Frameworks

### Back-end -> Meteor

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) is a NodeJS fullstack framework, [install here](https://www.meteor.com/install).

It's famous of its **reactive data** flow which does not follow the get post pattern, instead, the back-end **publishes** a dataset and font-end **subscribes** to it, and front-end will be **notified** if there is any changed made to the database (where the datasets are from).

I really suggest to go over a very basic [tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) provided by Meteor to have a better understanding of how it all works.

### Front-end -> React

Meteor has official support for React as its rendering engine (front-end), [guides can be found here](https://guide.meteor.com/react.html).

## Conventions

### Git

Please follow [this git model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) when commiting or pulling, committing directly to a none master branch is fine (no need for pulling request).

### JS

Use any style as you prefer, as long as its well commented and consistent, worst case [this coding style](https://github.com/elierotenberg/coding-styles/blob/master/es6.md), except semicolumns are optional. (I came from coffeescript, I hate ;;;)
